# Computer Cases and Half Racks

## History

In the deep dark times I made a 12" cube computer case for a nice compact fileserver. Since this was the middle
ages, I had made it all by hand with a hacksaw, rivets, metal stock and plastic panels. I still have it, but now
upgraded with some new fancy parts. It also started me on a path of making cases that fit with its form factor.
I now have a small collection of stackable computers that go with it. In addition to this, I found that the form
also makes for a nice mounting rack for the somewhat popular half rack units. It's all come together for a nice
system for me to spend lots of money on shiny stuff.

Given that it has it's roots in this 12" dimension, the project does has a mix of imperial and metric units. Sorry
about that, but it is what it is.

## OpenSCAD

I'm new to making stuff for OpenSCAD so I have no idea if my scripts are an abomination or not, but it works for me.
Not all the options are made to be used at the same time, they just hit different use cases I have.

## Assembly

TBD
